0. The coding language is C.
1. Do not put comments of any kind inside the code. Explain the code outside.
2. Only use while loop, it is forbidden to use for loop.
3. Declaration and assignment of variables must be on a different lines. You also can not declare or assign multiple variables at the same time. For example, this is forbidden: int y, x;
4. There can be maximum of 25 lines per function. Functions exceeding 25 lines limit can be broken down to smaller helper functions.
5. There can be maximum of 5 functions in a file.
6. There can be maximum of 4 parameters in a function declaration.
7. If not specified or already used, you cannot use any external libraries (for example string.h).
8. If statements with only one line inside don't require curly brackets.
9. It is forbidden to use ternary operators.
10. For every change in the code, make sure the functionality remains the same.
11. You can include some lines inside the return function, for example:

        free(stash);
        *stash = NULL;
        return (NULL);

    Can be rewritten to this:
    
        return (free(stash), *stash = NULL, NULL);

    This saves a lot of lines.
12. Suggest better solutions in terms of maintainability and DRY coding.
